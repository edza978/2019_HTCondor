# II Workshop Computational Platforms
This workshop is aimed to Masters and PhD students with an interest in topics such as High Performance Computing, Computational modeling and Distributed Systems. The presentations will be carried out in Spanish. For this occasion we hope to receive between 20/30 students.

## Event goals

The objective of this week's workshop is to publicize and encourage both Master's and Doctoral students to use the computational infrastructure available at the Universidad del Valle for scientific research purposes. In the same way, we will show how this computational infrastructure can be accessed and how the Networks and Distributed Systems Laboratory can assist students in the process.
